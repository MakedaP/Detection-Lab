# Detection Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project was meticulously designed with the ambitious goal of creating a sophisticated, controlled environment dedicated to the simulation and detection of cyber attacks. At the heart of this initiative was the establishment of a robust framework that would not only facilitate these simulations but also provide a comprehensive platform for the rigorous analysis and understanding of cyber threats.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Gained in-depth knowledge of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, learning to configure, manage, and utilize these systems to monitor and analyze security events in real-time
- Applied SIEM systems to simulate cyber attack scenarios, enabling the detection and analysis of threats, thereby reinforcing the theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience.
- Cultivated the ability to create and identify unique signatures and patterns that signify cyber attacks, a critical aspect of proactive cybersecurity measures
- Leveraged network log analysis to trace the source and method of simulated cyber attacks within the lab environment, enhancing the ability to pinpoint vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
- Engaged in scenario-based learning within the Detection Lab, applying these cognitive skills to strategize, execute, and refine cyber defense mechanisms effectively.

### Tools Used

- SIEM (Splunk)
- Network Analysis Tools for capturing and examining network traffic (Wireshark)
- Tools for generating telemetry to simulate authentic network traffic and cyber attack scenarios.
- VirusTotal
